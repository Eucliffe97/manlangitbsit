                INFASS is a subject that focuses on the protection of data and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and destruction. 
                Through studying INFASS, several key learnings about data security can be gained. Firstly, the importance of 
                implementing strong encryption techniques to secure sensitive data cannot be overstated. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains 
                unreadable to unauthorized individuals. Secondly, the subject emphasizes the significance of access controls and user authentication mechanisms. Implementing 
                strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control helps restrict data access to authorized personnel only. Thirdly, regular software 
                updates and patches are vital for addressing known vulnerabilities and keeping systems secure. Additionally, INFASS teaches the significance of data backup and 
                recovery processes to mitigate the risk of data loss and ensure business continuity.

                WEBTEC is a subject that covers essential web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
                Through studying WEBTEC, several key learnings can be gained about these technologies. Firstly, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages, and understanding its structure and elements is fundamental. 
                It teaches how to create semantic and accessible web content using HTML tags to structure the different parts of a webpage. Secondly, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is crucial for styling web pages and creating visually appealing designs. 
                WEBTEC explores CSS selectors, properties, and layouts to customize the appearance and layout of HTML elements. Furthermore, JavaScript is a powerful scripting language for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. 
                In WEBTEC, students learn JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, events, and DOM manipulation to create interactive web experiences. Lastly, WEBTEC covers Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that provides pre-designed components and responsive layouts. 
                Students learn how to utilize Bootstrap to build responsive and mobile-friendly websites efficiently. Overall, WEBTEC equips students with the necessary skills to develop modern and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, empowering them to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences.
